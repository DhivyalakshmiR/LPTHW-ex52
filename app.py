# This exercise guides you in creating a web-based game engine for a text adventure game.
# You'll refactor existing code from a exercise 43, combining it with concepts from
# exercise 47 â€“ Automated testing to build a game structure. The first step involves
# copying and organizing code into specific files. Then, you'll refactor the map to include
# all necessary rooms and transitions. Additionally, you'll create automated tests to
# ensure the functionality of the map. Next, you'll develop a game engine using Flask,
# which will handle game sessions, user input, and navigation through the game's rooms.
# Finally, you'll create HTML templates for displaying the game's rooms and handling game
# over scenarios. Throughout the process, you'll run tests and debug to ensure everything
# works correctly.
